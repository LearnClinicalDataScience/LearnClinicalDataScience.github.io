# Coursera Clinical Data Science Specialization

## Welcome to the Tech Platform Beta Test!

Today you’ll be testing a small portion of a Coursera course. By signing up, students will given an account on an RStudio Server hosted by Google Cloud and allowed to run queries on Google BigQuery. 

You can find all of the instructions at www.learnclinicaldatascience.org

You can provide feedback on the test [here](https://goo.gl/forms/DkMnz7pn5rGaShlH3)

### Register for Access
Please register for an [account](https://goo.gl/forms/EgPoY3iS63hQs5Ud2)

Please complete the form above, paying close attention to each prompt. Note that to access the system you must accept both the Terms of Service and the MIMIC Data Use Agreement!

* Did the form behave as you would expect?
* Anything misleading or confusing?

It will take about 10 minutes for your account to be created, hang out and enjoy the food! 

### Access course materials

After about 10 minutes, your account should be ready and you can log in to two systems:

* RStudio Server: [rstudio.learnclinicaldatascience.org](https://rstudio.learnclinicaldatascience.org)
* Google BigQuery: [bigquery.cloud.google.com](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/welcome)

Please try accessing both systems. 

#### If you don't program 

There are two ways you can help us:

1. Test RStudio by following these instructions:
..* Go to [rstudio.learnclinicaldatascience.org](https://rstudio.learnclinicaldatascience.org)
..* Log in using the google account you registered with.
..* In the lower right corner of your screen you will see the files tab. Click the file "CourseraBetaTest.Rmd"
..* Once you see the file open in the top left of your screen, just click the "Knit" and then "Knit to PDF" option.
..* This may stop and ask you to approve bigquery. When this happens, sign into tthe same google account again, then copy the text it returns and paste it into the "Console" (lower left corner).
..* That's it! Try the Bigquery system next!
2. Test Google Bigquery by following these instructions:
..* Go to [bigquery.cloud.google.com](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/welcome)
..* Click the "Compose Query" button on the top left.
..* Copy and paste this query: select * from MIMIC3_DEMO.CHARTEVENTS
..* That's it! Provide any feedback on the system and thank you so much for your time!
  
#### If you _do_ program

Please access both systems and play around! 

Try running some basic R functions
* Load/install packages (user space limited to 100mb)
* Create some plots
* Export your work

See what you can break!
* Do you have access to things that you shouldn’t?
* Can you see other student’s work?
* Anything slow to respond?
